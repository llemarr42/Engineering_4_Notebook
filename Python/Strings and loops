print("type in your, text then press Enter:")    
x=input("")       # input on new line
txt = x.replace(" ", "-") # replaces spaces with dashes
for x in txt: # For every Character in txt
  print(x) # Print that character


Spicy version:
for x in input("type in your, text then press Enter:").replace(" ", "-"): print(x) # For every character in the input that you type that has all the spaces replaced with dashes print the xth character
